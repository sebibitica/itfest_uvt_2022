# I'm here

Because making sure that everyone at the course is there is hard we brought you "I'm here". A React Native application that combines social fun with the attendace list.

The user is welcomed with a strat page, where he can choose to Login or Register:
<img src="./readmeImages/start.jpg" width="288" height="512">

Than the user input:
<div style="flex-direction:row">
  <img src="./readmeImages/login.jpg" width="288" height="512">
  <img src="./readmeImages/register.jpg" width="288" height="512">
<div>

After that the student is sent to the courses on that day:
<img src="./readmeImages/courses.jpg" width="288" height="512">

And every link has the attendace list under the form of a social app:
<img src="./readmeImages/feed.jpg" width="288" height="512">

The student can take his photo:
<div style="flex-direction:row">
  <img src="./readmeImages/transition.jpg" width="288" height="512">
  <img src="./readmeImages/camera.jpg" width="288" height="512">
<div>
